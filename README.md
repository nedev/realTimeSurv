# realTimeSurv

The realTimeSurv package for R provides a set of computational tools and user-friendly wrappers to software for the application of real-time disease surveillance. 
The underlying statistical model is a Log Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP), estimated using a parallelised version of the MCMC sampler from the lgcp package. 
A suite of visualisation and analysis tools are provided that are designed to be user-friendly and quick to implement as well as access to useful data sets.

The realTimeSurv package is currently under development. Once complete this readme will be updated. A draft user vignette can be accessed at https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rdrappk68u7jiw/Vignette%20v3.pdf?dl=0
